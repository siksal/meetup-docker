# Turtlebot3 on ROS 2 Humble - Docker

This Docker container contains [ROS 2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/), Gazebo Classic, and the [TurtleBot 3 simulation](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/).

ðŸ‘‰ This Docker container is meant to be used with this [LQR code for a TB3 node](tbd) and the associated ROS Meetup Lagos talk by Femi Ayoade.

ðŸ‘‰ This Docker also includes a full ROS 2 Humble install. If you would like to brush up on your ROS skills you can work through the ROS 2 tutorials. We suggest you start with the [CLI Tutorials.](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools.html)
